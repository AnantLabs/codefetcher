# * Use the '#' character at the beginning of a line to comment it out.
# * Changes will take effect after the program is restarted.
# * To restore the defaults, simply delete this file. It will be recreated the
#   next time the program is started.

# The text to display in the title bar of the main window and in the task bar.
# This setting might be useful for rebranding and for using multiple instances
# of DocFetcher.

# Whether to show a link to this file on the preferences dialog. Disable this
# setting to prevent users from mucking around in this file.

# If this is true, the program will not store changes made by the user to the
# sizes of the various program windows. Instead, it will always reload the last
# saved sizes on startup.

# Whether to use curvy or rectangular tabs.

# HTML file extensions. This setting will affect detection of HTML files and
# DocFetcher's HTML pairing mechanism.

# The maximum number of lines to display in the indexing progress panel. When
# the number of lines exceeds this limit, lines at the top will be discarded.
# Setting a value that is too high may cause the program to crash with an
# OutOfMemoryError.

# The capacity of the unpack cache. The latter holds archive entries that were

# split into words. The StandardAnalyzer is suitable in most cases, but the
# SourceCodeAnalyzer may give better results for source code files (e.g. it
# splits words containing dots, such as 'list.iterator').
# Important: After changing this option, you must rebuild all existing indexes,
# otherwise you might get inconsistent search results.
